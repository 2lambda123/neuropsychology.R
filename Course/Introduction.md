## About the course

This course was crafted by psychologists, neuropsychologists and neuroscientists for psychologists, neuropsychologists and neuroscientists.
As such, it is a straighforward introduction to R with a special focus on how to get some actual results with it.
It is not a programming course, nor a course on statistics *per se*.

It is meant to be a short, straight to the point tutorial, that will not teach you R, nor statistics, but only how do quickly and easily do some things with your data using R.

Note that there are other tutorials teaching R for psychological research, that are deeper, longer and more comprehensive (such as [this one](http://personality-project.org/r/)).

## Installation of R

### R

Download and install R for [MacOS](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/), [Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/) or [Linux](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/).
